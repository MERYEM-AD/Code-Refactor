# Extra devlopping code :

* I developed the web page with my own code by adding an icon image as the logo of the company in the Tab's windows of the web page.
* I add an icon in the right bottom of the page, that allows the client to go Up of the page.

# GitBash & GitHub:

* Commit with msg every modification in code.
* Pushing to the repo in GitHub. 

# Isues:

* I found it hard to set the three sections (Search Engine Optimization , Online Reputation Management , Social Media Marketing) as the mock-up ("I talk about the resolution"), Then I found two ways can solve the issues
    1*/ reduce the width of the content, then centered with position properties;
    2*/ Use margin-right for the header and the paragraph and then use position: relative; same for the image but it will not seems 100% as the mock-up.
